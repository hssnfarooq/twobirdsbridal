            able to assist you and/or may offer a limited time which will not be

            at least 3 to 4 weeks for your fittings (finalizing your gown
            in-house) and can pick up your dress prior to your wedding.

            In addition to that, if you book your

        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            When you ordering your made-to-measure or custom-made gown, you pay
            a deposit instead of paying it fully, The remaining amount is due in
            your first fitting when we are in the final stage of finalizing your

          <p>
            If you purchase an off-the-rack gown, you can still pay a deposit

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            Yes, we take your exact measurements and make your dress but you
            still may need minor alterations to be done in-house when we start
            finalizing your gown. A minimum of 6 to 8 months is required to make
            your <strong>made-to-measure wedding dress</strong>, you may change
            in size during the time so, there might be alterations and
            additional cost. If you know in advance that you will lose or gain
            weight, we can take your measurements slightly tighter or wider, but
            there still might be alteration fees on top. But donâ€™t worry, we
            finalize all our gowns in-house and work until our brides are fully
            satisfied. In any case, we are still able to alter your dress and
            make it fit perfectly!

        </h3>
        <div class="answer">
          <p>
            We usually offer 2 fittings. We call them the first and final
            fittings. As soon as we are in the final stage of finalizing your
            gown and we have it in the store, we call you and book you for your
            first fitting. You need to bring your wedding shoes (or heels with a
            similar height), and together we check the fit of the dress, length,
            etc. If any alteration is needed, we discuss that with you in detail
            during your first fitting. You can also order a bustle for your
            train at this stage if needed, which will be done in time for your
            final fitting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The first two fitting appointments are free of charge. Additional
            fitting appointments which are optional are charged at $150 per
            appointment and are nonrefundable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Please note:</strong> As we do not have dressmakers on the
            premises on the weekend, we are unable to accept fitting
            appointments on Saturdays and Sundays.

          <p>
            Yes. We always prefer to have a long-lasting and trusting
            relationship with our brides. A contract will help us achieve this
            by holding both TwoBirds Bridal and our bride accountable for the
            agreement. We need to guarantee that we deliver your gown that
            matches the description in a timely manner before your wedding,
            while you promise that youâ€™ll follow your order. Itâ€™s a win-win
            situation for us in the end!

          <p>
            Since your custom-made or made-to-measure wedding gown is specially
            made according to your body measurements and/or specifications, we
            are unable to offer you a refund or exchange due to a change of mind
            or circumstances. Making changes after your order may occur a
            further cost and delays in the construction process of your gown.
            That is why we do not recommend making changes after your initial
            order. It is very important to be absolutely sure of the design and
            specifications before you place your order and signing the
            agreement.
